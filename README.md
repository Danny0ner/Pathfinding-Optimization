Pathfinding is an important resource on many games, the basic algorithms like BFS, DJikstra or A* may work fine on some games, but in some cases, especially on large maps, they can be slow and make your game stops for a moment until it finds the path or slow the game.
That makes its optimization so important, because you want your program or game to be as fast as possible for possible future expansions of the same. In this document you will find, a quick explanation of A*, some little optimizations for it, an explanation of the most used optimizations derived from the A* algorithm and a guide to implement the HPA algorithm.
